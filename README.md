What is WeyCoin?
----------------

WeyCoin is a unique form of cryptocurrency, we aim at creating the ultimate
platform where users can like (cluck), dislike (spit), or share memes. This
is an implementation that will work in tandem with the blockchain, and to
ultimately develop the first true Proof-of-Meme (PoM) cryptocurrency. So far,
WeyCoin basis its roots in the framework of [Straks](https://github.com/straks/straks).

As such, many of the features and implementations work similarly to our predecessor,
this includes masternodes, SegWit 2X/4X, Lightning Network implementation and much more.

The full outline of our work can be found on our primary website - [WeyCoin.org](https://weycoin.org)


Whitepaper
----------

We are currently in the process of writing out a delicate whitepaper outlining
all of the obstacles we must overcome in our duty. We are fully aware of the
implications of creating a fully funcitonal side-platform to implement PoM.
