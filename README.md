What is WeyCoin?
----------------

WeyCoin is a unique form of cryptocurrency, we aim at creating the ultimate
platform where users can like (cluck), dislike (spit), or share memes. This
is an implementation that will work in tandem with the blockchain, and to
ultimately develop the first true Proof-of-Meme (PoM) cryptocurrency. So far,
WeyCoin basis its roots in the framework of [Straks](https://github.com/straks/straks).

As such, many of the features and implementations work similarly to our predecessor,
this includes masternodes, SegWit 2X/4X, Lightning Network implementation and much more.

The full outline of our work can be found on our primary website - [WeyCoin.org](https://weycoin.org)


Masternodes
-----------

We offer masternodes at a much cheaper price when contrasted to our overall supply. 15,000 WAE is all
one needs to create a masternode. The tutorials for the setup can be found in our official discord.


Proof-of-Meme
-------------

The main purpose behind WeyCoin is to allow a community of people to share, like, dislike and post memes,
and in turn be rewarded with our currency. This integration will be implemented directly into our blockchain. More information about how this will be done is available in the upcoming whitepaper.
